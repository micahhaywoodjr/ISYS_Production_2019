    <subject>New Referral O&apos;Reilly ER Assessment Due {!Case.Employee_Case_Trakker__c}</subject>
    <textOnly>Hello {!Case.OwnerFirstName},
 
This is a courtesy notification regarding your new Gallagher Bassett referral on {!Case.Employee__c} for employer O&apos;Reilly Auto.  
 
It is necessary that your professional assessment of the case is accurately reflected in your Initial report &quot;Projected Closure Date&quot; field.  Additionally, we need to be informed on both the anticipated P&amp;S date as well as the projected closure date.
 
Please ensure you create and update your Initial Case Report promptly and email Diane with both dates upon completion of your assessment.
 
As always, thank you for your attention to this immediate need.
